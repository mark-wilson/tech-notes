# About tech-notes
tech-notes is a collection of notes and links that I've found useful as I've gone about [my work][1]. One upon a time I would have blogged these things. For many years I would have used Twitter. More recently I've been disenchanted with "social" media and too time-poor for blog posts, so  been looking for somewhere else to collect my notes.

I'm a big fan of [Markdown][2], and I had some good experiences at work with the Azure DevOps wiki functionality but I needed something that would be easy to write into and to publish on the Internet. Right now, this is in [GitHub Pages][3]. I think the content should be easy to maintain if I need to take it somewhere else but it's all a bit experimental.

I also have thoughts about a book, but they have not quite come together yet. All I can say is watch this space.
