# Acknowledgments
Many of the notes contained in these pages have been pulled together based on conversations (online or in person). There's a huge list of people who have, whether knowingly or otherwise, helped me shape my views and opinions on IT Transformation. Some are attributed directly in the text. Others are not - maybe it was just a passing comment, or on a forum where we have an unwritten rule not to share information with attribution ([the Chatham House rule][1]).

This chapter is an opportunity for me to thank those people. In no particular order:

- David Wright, who saw the potential in a young Graduate Trainee and gave him the chance to grow, at ICL, in a brave new world at Capita (even if that didn't work out so well), and then back at Fujitsu. 
- Garry Martin, who realised I was more than just a techie and gave me the confidence to go after more strategic roles.
- David Smith and Mark Locke, who gave me my first opportunity to work in a CTO function, and helped me to develop as a "strategic-thinking technologist" (those are David's words, which I have adopted).
- Alan Purchase, who supported me in my first management role, teaching me that, whatever I find difficult today, will seem so much more straightforward when I look back at it in a few months.
- Alun Rogers, for always being visionary - even if sometimes I struggled to keep up.
- Brian Cain, who had the unfortunate task of keeping my mind on track whilst working as an Architect at risual.
- Andrew Hutchinson, Thom McKiernan, Bjoern Hirtenjohann, Andy Hodkinson, and the many Architects I worked with at risual whose discussions helped me cement some of the thoughts in these pages.
- Gregg Mearing, for recognising the potential that I could offer to his OCTO team at Node4.
- Geoff Barlow and the rest of the Node4 OCTO team.
- Matt Ballantine, Chris Weston, and the entire WB-40 Community for [the podcasts][2] and the many hours of discussion on our Signal group.

And, of course, my wife, Nikki, for her constant support and tolerance of the frustrated technologist who was struggling to find his place in the world of IT.
