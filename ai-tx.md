# Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformation
For years, we've talked about "the [cloud][1]" and about [digital transformation][2] but in the mid-2020s, we started to see a huge leap forward in Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities - specifically around generative AI (gAI) and large language models (LLMs).

This goes further than digital transformation and we are entering a new era of "AI transformation".

"A digital and Al transformation is the process of developing organisational and technology-based capabilities that allows a company to improve continuously its customer experience, lower its costs, and, over time, sustain a competitive advantage." [Kevin Ingrey]


## Digital assistants

### ChatGPT

### Dall-E

### Bing Chat Enterprise

### Microsoft Copilot
In 2023, Microsoft started to market a whole range of assistive AI technologies as "Copilots". The idea is that these tools work alongside their human knowledge-worker counterparts and provide assistance. And what's not to like?

The trouble is, that we can't (or at least shouldn't) view these assistants as anything more than that. They are not always correct.

When fed some notes from a meeting and asked to summarise, an AI assistant did a great job of producing a summary. Except for one thing. It surmised that the client name was "Node4". In fact, Node4 was the name of the managed service provider - the client was a UK building society. It used to be that "content is king". Now, I might argue that it's _context_ we need to ensure - whether that's in our prompts or in the information we provide for analysis.

The example above was Bing Chat Enterprise but could just have well been a Copilot (it's all related technology). As one of my colleagues suggested - Copilot is great, but you still need to have a pilot's licence to really fly. He continued that we shouldn't part company with business application partners just yet because someone has to maintain the tools that we might create using AI. That's a good point. Only a week earlier, I'd been developing spreadsheets and using an AI to help me write the various formulae. They took some tweaking - far less than if I'd written them from scratch - but let's not lose those analytical and programming skills just yet!

Another colleague posited a view that he'd been thinking about the idea of AI Assistants (Copilot etc., rather than something more narrow based on Machine Learning), giving people "breadth" of skills as opposed to "depth" of skills. It works in terms of developers/technical areas, where Copilot is great at allowing a developer who already knows Python to also work in Typescript, but it won't make them a better Python developer. Similarly, take someone who is really good at Excel, but can't build Apps. It'll allow them to build simple apps in PowerApps, but it won't make them a great App developer. If someone is super knowledgeable in a specific area, but not good at presenting their thoughts, a Copilot in PowerPoint will help.

Then there's the cost. Some organisations will baulk at the idea of paying £30/user/month for Copilot. But could that be an investment. We pay for other productvity tools - a laptop, smartphone, connectivity - so why not an AI assistant? In reality, not everyone needs a Copilot. Bing Chat Enterprise may be more cost-effective for many scenarios.  

## AI won't save your internal communications problem

The text below is from a post by Sharon O'Dea, an expert on the digital workplace, communication, collaboration and the future of work. [Sharon posted this on LinkedIn][3] in October 2023, just as Microsoft was releasing Copilot to general availability:

> "We need to talk about AI. I know, all of LinkedIn wants to talk about AI.
>
> But let me tell it how it is: AI is not going to solve your internal communications problem.
>
> In my 15-plus years rolling out digital workplace tools in tens of organisations, I’ve seen vendors, consultants and in-house teams join forces to wildly oversell the benefits of this technology or that. Portals, enterprise social, user-generated content, bots, they were all going to transform our organisations. And guess what? They didn’t.
>
> SharePoint has been promising to transform productivity for a quarter of a century and… \<gestures broadly at everything\>.
>
> AI won't solve your problem, but it can help. But it can only do that if you put in the neccessary-but-unsexy work on content, process, people and governance first. Otherwise you risk wasting your money, or even making things worse.
>
> As an example: Enterprise AI tools like Microsoft Copilot can surface and use content within your tenancy to connect disparate bits of information, surface answers, boost relevance and make the most of your intellectual capital. The problem is, it’s likely a lot of your content is Just Not Very Good. Without a solid content strategy and content governance in place, you risk making inaccurate content more visible, and having it regenerate into new inaccurate content.
>
> Organisations need to have a governance framework in place to manage the use of AI, to minimise the risk of unintended outcomes. This framework should address issues such as ethics, bias, privacy, and security.
>
> Technology is the easy part. To get real value from any investment in tech you need PEOPLE to actually use it, and to use it effectively. This could mean knowing the basics of refining prompts or turning insights into decision-making in what I’ve heard called the “Employee-AI Alliance”. Unless you have a plan for people, you won’t get the returns you expect from investment in tech.
>
> I am (genuinely) bullish on the potential for AI to make work better. MUCH better. But while it’s a powerful tool, it's not a magic bullet; these don’t exist.
>
> Learn from all the overhyped, failed digital workplace platforms of the past and get the basics of content and governance in place before you do anything else. Spend at least as much of your budget on training people as you do on tech.
>
> And don’t believe the hype: AI Won't Solve Your Internal Communications Problem."
