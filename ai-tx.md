# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transformation
For years, we've talked about "the [cloud](cloud-tx.md)" and about [digital transformation](digital-tx.md) but in the mid-2020s, we started to see a huge leap forward in Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities - specifically around generative AI (gAI) and large language models (LLMs).

This goes further than digital transformation and we are entering a new era of "AI transformation".

## Digital Assistants

### Chat GPT

### Dall-E

### Bing Chat Enterprise

### Microsoft Copilot
In 2023, Microsoft started to market a whole range of assistive AI technologies as "Copilots". The idea is that these tools work alongside their human knowledge-worker counterparts and provide assistance. And what's not to like?

The trouble is, that we can't (or at least shouldn't) view these assistants as anything more than that. They are not always correct.

When fed some notes from a meeting and asked to summarise, an AI assistant did a great job of producing a summary. Except for one thing. It summised that the client name was "Node4". In fact, Node4 was the name of the managed service provider - the client was a UK building society. It used to be that "content is king". Now, I might argue that it's _context_ we need to ensure - whether that's in our prompts or in the information we provide for analysis.

The example above was Bing Chat Enterprise but could just have well been a Copilot (it's all related technology). As one of my colleagues suggested - Copilot is great, but you still need to have a pilot's licence to really fly. He continued that we shouldn't part company with business application partners just yet because someone has to maintain the tools that we might create using AI. That's a good point. Only a week earlier, I'd been developing spreadsheets and using an AI to help me write the various formulae. They took some tweaking - far less than if I'd written them from scratch - but let's not lose those analytical and programming skills just yet!

Another colleague posited a view that he'd been thinking about the idea of AI Assistants (Copilot etc., rather than something more narrow based on Machine Learning), giving people "breadth" of skills as opposed to "depth" of skills. It works in terms of developers/technical areas, where Copilot is great at allowing a developer who already knows Python to also work in Typescript, but it won't make them a better Python developer. Similarly, take someone who is really good at Excel, but can't build Apps. It'll allow them to build simple apps in PowerApps, but it won't make them a great App developer. If someone is super knowledgeable in a specific area, but not good at presenting their thoughts, a Copilot in PowerPoint will help.

Then there's the cost. Some organisations will baulk at the idea of paying Â£30/user/month for Copilot. But could that be an investment. We pay for other productvity tools - a laptop, smartphone, connectivity - so why not an AI assistant? In reality, not everyone needs a Copilot. Bing Chat Enterprise may be more cost-effective for many scenarios.
