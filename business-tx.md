# Business Transformation
Business transformation is about re-engineering internal processes to better serve the needs of the business and improve the way in which services are delivered. It’s about driving efficiencies and delivering better outcomes, but still focused on the way that a business (or other organisation) operates. Business transformation should be business-led but will often (but not always) demand new platforms and services from IT – which leads back to [cloud transformation](cloud-tx.md).

Business transformation is not a pre-requisite for [digital transformation](digital-tx.md) - but it will certainly help.
