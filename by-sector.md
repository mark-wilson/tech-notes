# Sector-specific notes
Part way through writing this book, it struck me that it might be a good think to take a look at some of the challenges faced by organisations on a sector-by-sector basis.

Conversely, just because your organisation operates in one sector doesn't mean it won't recognise some of the problems faced elsewhere.
