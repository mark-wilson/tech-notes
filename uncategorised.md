# Other Stuff
This is the place for all the unfiled notes... the ones that didn't fit under the other transformation categories and sit here until I find they are big enough to need their own place in the structure.

## On new technologies
(In the context of AI, but also more broadly)

"There are two principal and immediate risks with any new technology: the first is to fetishise it and the second is to demonise it - and i think both are problematic. The issue for me is - and will always be -  where is it being used, by whom to what effect, and with what level of accountability?" \[[Professor Fraser Sampson, UK Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material and Surveillance Camera Commissioner][1], [BBC Tech Life 19/9/23][2]\]

## On selling products and services

Look at business issues - what are we going to do over the next 12, 15, 18m?

Selling is a process:
1. Build relationships
2. Understand client needs
3. Fill the gap

Success is not just about achieving a number but more about how we can see:
- Pipeline growth
- Product attachment
- Average deal size increase
- Utilisation up and at right run rate
- Feedback from teams - feeling empowered, having fun, feeling successful
- Developing skill sets and working on a wider knowledge set to take to clients

## Architecture points
### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (Ben Curtis)
Have you ever wondered how products like cars, kitchen appliances, or even your favorite gadgets are designed to meet your needs? Well, it all starts with two important types of requirements: functional and non-functional. Let's explore them using examples that everyone can relate to.

Functional requirements are like the basic functions or tasks a product needs to perform. They're the blueprint that outlines what the product should do.

Let's consider a car. Some functional requirements for a car may include:

- Acceleration: The car should be able to speed up smoothly when you press the accelerator pedal.
- Braking: It should come to a complete stop when you apply the brakes, ensuring safety.
Steering: The car should respond accurately to steering wheel movements, allowing you to navigate turns easily.
- Climate Control: It should have air conditioning and heating systems to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
- Entertainment System: The car should have a radio or media player for music and audio entertainment during the drive.

These functional requirements ensure that the car performs the essential tasks needed for driving comfortably and safely.

Now let's consider a technical example like a web-based email application. Some functional requirements might include:

- User Authentication: Users should be able to log in securely using their username, password and MFA.
- Send Email: Users should be able to compose and send emails to other recipients.
- Receive Email: The application should receive and display incoming emails in the user's inbox.
- Attachment Support: Users should be able to attach files (e.g., documents, images) to their emails.
- Search Functionality: Users should be able to search for specific emails using keywords or filters.

These functional requirements outline the essential tasks the email application must perform to be considered functional.

Non-functional requirements focus more on the quality aspects of the product rather than its specific functions. They define how well the product performs those functions and the overall user experience it delivers.

Driving forward with our car example (ðŸ˜‰), some non-functional requirements may include:

1. Fuel Efficiency: The car should use fuel efficiently to minimise trips to the petrol station and reduce expenses.
2. Safety Features: It should have airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and traction control for enhanced safety.
3. Comfort: The seats should be ergonomic and supportive, providing a comfortable ride even on long journeys.
4. Durability: The car's components should be durable and long-lasting, requiring minimal maintenance over time.
5. Noise Reduction: It should be designed to minimise external noise, providing a quieter and more relaxing driving experience.

These non-functional requirements ensure that the car not only performs its functions but also delivers a high-quality driving experience that meets user expectations.

With the email application, some non-functional requirements might include:

- Performance: The application should load within two seconds, even under high user traffic.
- Security: User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorised access.
- Scalability: The application should handle a growing number of users without significant degradation in performance.
- Reliability: It should be available 99.9% of the time, with minimal downtime for maintenance or updates.
- Usability: The interface should be intuitive, with clear navigation and responsive design across devices.

These non-functional requirements ensure that the email application not only functions but also provides a seamless and reliable user experience.

To summarise:
- Functional Requirements: Define what the product doesâ€”its specific tasks or functionalities.
- Non-Functional Requirements: Define how well the product performs those tasks and the overall quality of the user experience.
 
So next time you're using Netflix, driving in your car, or even sitting on your toilet - take a moment to appreciate the carefully drafted set of requirements that put the product in your hands (or under your bottom!).
