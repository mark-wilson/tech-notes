## On new technologies
(In the context of AI, but also more broadly)

"There are two principal and immediate risks with any new technology: the first is to fetishise it and the second is to demonise it - and i think both are problematic. The issue for me is - and will always be -  where is it being used, by whom to what effect, and with what level of accountability?" \[[Professor Fraser Sampson, UK Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material and Surveillance Camera Commissioner](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/fraser-sampson), [BBC Tech Life 19/9/23](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct4tqd)\]

## On selling products and services

Look at business issues - what are we going to do over the next 12, 15, 18m?

Selling is a process:
1. Build relationships
2. Understand client needs
3. Fill the gap

Success is not just about achieving a number but more about how we can see:
- Pipeline growth
- Product attachment
- Average deal size increase
- Utilisation up and at right run rate
- Feedback from teams - feeling empowered, having fun, feeling successful
- Developing skill sets and working on a wider knowledge set to take to clients
