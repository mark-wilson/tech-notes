# Cloud Transformation
Cloud transformation is about tools and technology. It’s often IT-led (though it should involve business stakeholders too) and so it’s the domain where us techies are most happy. Often, it involves creating new platforms, using cloud services – Azure, Amazon Web Services, Office 365, G-Suite, Dynamics 365, Salesforce. But cloud transformation is just an enabler. In order to deliver value, [business transformation](business-tx.md) is required.

## What do we mean by "Cloud"?
In the early 2010s, everything was trying to be cloudy. If you ran a server in a datacentre and provided services to others (an application service provider), you probably said you were "on the cloud". These were the wild west days of cloud computing. A farm of virtual machines became "a private cloud", regardless of how they were managed and operated. 

Thankfully, the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wrote a paper, which should be required reading for anyone getting their head around cloud computing. [The NIST Definition of Cloud 
Computing](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf) defines the concepts we all settled on:

- The essential characteristics of cloud computing: on-demand self service; broad network access; resource pooling; rapid elasticity; and measured service.
- The service models: infrastructure-; platform-; and software-as-a-service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS).
- The deployment models: public; private; community; and hybrid clouds.
