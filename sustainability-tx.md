**The following text was written by an AI and needs to be reviewed/edited.**

Sustainability transformation is a term that refers to the process of changing society and its systems in a way that supports the well-being of people and the planet, both now and in the future. It involves addressing the root causes of environmental and social problems, such as unsustainable consumption, inequality, and injustice, and creating new ways of living and working that are more harmonious with nature and human values. Sustainability transformation is not just a technical or economic challenge, but also a cultural, political, and ethical one. It requires a shift in mindsets, values, and behaviors, as well as in institutions, policies, and practices.

There is no single definition or approach to sustainability transformation, as different disciplines and fields may emphasize different aspects or dimensions of it. However, some common elements that are often mentioned in the literature are:

- Sustainability transformation is systemic. It affects multiple domains and levels of society, such as the economy, politics, culture, technology, and ecology. It also involves interactions and feedbacks between these domains and levels, as well as between human and natural systems.
- Sustainability transformation is normative. It is guided by a vision of a desirable future that is based on ethical principles and values, such as justice, equity, diversity, democracy, and resilience. It also involves critical reflection on the current state of affairs and the underlying assumptions and paradigms that shape it.
- Sustainability transformation is emergent. It is not a predetermined or linear process, but rather a dynamic and complex one that involves uncertainty, ambiguity, and surprises. It also involves learning, experimentation, innovation, and adaptation to changing contexts and conditions.
- Sustainability transformation is participatory. It involves the engagement and empowerment of diverse actors and stakeholders who have different perspectives, interests, and roles in society. It also involves collaboration, dialogue, deliberation, and conflict resolution among these actors and stakeholders.
